# Rocchio_Method_for_Doc_Classification
Document Classification Using Rocchio Method

### What is Rocchio's Method?
Rocchio's method is a classic algorithm used for document classification. It is a centroid-based approach that assigns a document to a specific class by comparing its similarity to the centroids of different classes. The algorithm is based on the assumption that documents in the same class share similar feature vectors.


**Rocchio's Method**
$$\left(Q_1 \right) \=    \left(beta \sum_{i=1}^(n_1) (R_i)/(n_1) \right) -  left(gamma \sum_{i=1}^(n_2) (S_i)/(n_2) \right)                  $$
$$\left( \sum_{k=1}^n a_k b_k \right)^2 \leq \left( \sum_{k=1}^n a_k^2 \right) \left( \sum_{k=1}^n b_k^2 \right)$$
